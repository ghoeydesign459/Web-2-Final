        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>Nike SB is Nike's dedication to skateboarding. Pure and simple. Respect the past, embrace the future. Nike’s foray into the world of skateboarding began in 1997 with a new line of sneakers aimed at skateboarders. The early 2000’s saw a swift turnaround from the brand thanks to recruiting skateboarding giants like Paul Rodriguez to front the team.

Since then Nike SB has continued to have an influence in the skateboarding industry, establishing themselves among the community with innovation in technology and an eye for emerging skateboarding talent.</p>
