                        <p>Nike SB launches their first-ever shoes in March of 2002, a collection of signature Dunks to
                            each of their pros. The Danny Supa Los Angeles Dunk, a Gino Iannucci Long Island New York
                            Dunk, a Richard Mulder Los Angeles Dunk (that was also based on the colors of his first Nike
                            shoes ever), and a Reese Forbes Wheat Dunk (based off of his favorite work boots).</p>

                        <p>Nike SB is Nike's dedication to skateboarding. Pure and simple. Respect the past, embrace the future. Nike’s foray into the world of skateboarding began in 1997 with a new line of sneakers aimed at skateboarders. The early 2000’s saw a swift turnaround from the brand thanks to recruiting skateboarding giants like Paul Rodriguez to front the team. With Rodriguez came a line of shoes specifically designed with skateboarders in mind, boasting increased padding, Zoom Air insoles, and enhanced materials, including triple stitching, a standard for skate shoes. Since then Nike SB has continued to have an influence in the skateboarding industry, establishing themselves among the community with innovation in technology and an eye for emerging skateboarding talent.</p>

                        <h1>The SB Team</h1>
                        <p>The early team included names like Daniel Shimizu, Danny Supa, Paul Rodriguez, Gino Iannucci, Reese Forbes, Richard Mulder, Brian Anderson and more. After Nike SB began, the anticipation for the first video was almost palpable in any skate shop. The roster was solid, and the thought of Nike budgets behind some of the best skaters in the world had even the utmost of haters eager to see what was to come.  After much anticipation, Nike SB released On Tap in 2004, which featured the likes of P-Rod, Brian Anderson, Chet Childress, Reese Forbes, Gino Iannucci, Todd Jordan, Richard Mulder, Daniel Shimizu, Danny Supa and more. It was clear, with the help of P-Rod’s 2004 X-Games Gold Medal, Nike SB wasn’t just a fad, but a force that would shape the future of skateboarding.</p>
